## Research Questions

* What is the optimal way to separate the movies contained in the data set (which clustering methods... hand made...?)
* Having made this division, how different are the groups generated?
* Is IMDB score correlated to any of the features? Can we use the existing and generated features as IMDB score predictors?
*
