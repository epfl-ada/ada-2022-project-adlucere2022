## Abstract

In the current age of easy access to humanity's greatest cinematic acheivements when we like and how we like, we often wish to seek out the best of the best when looking for a way to spend an afternoon. But what really makes a movie a critical success? Is it an artistic X factor, the result of a director, the cast and the crew pouring their heart and soul into a project, or are there measurable factors that influence if we see a film as "high quality"? Is there a recipe for a critical darling? In this project we attempt to gain a deeper understanding of what makes a movie a critical success using a data-driven approach. Our analysitakes into account several factors and takes advantage of the large amounts of lexical data provided in the data set using feature extraction.

## Research Questions

* What is the optimal way to separate the movies contained in the data set (which clustering methods... hand made...?)
* Having made this division, how different are the groups generated?
* Is IMDB score correlated to any of the features? Can we use the existing and generated features as IMDB score predictors?
* 


## Additional Datasets

* IMDB dataset: included as to enrich the selected dataset's features. After analysis only the IMDB score was kept.
